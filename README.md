# Optimal control and Bayes inference applied to complex microbial communities under antimicrobials
Interactions between species are essential in ecosystems, but sometimes competition dominates over mutualism. 
The transition between mutualism-competition can have several implications and consequences, and it has hardly been 
studied in experimental settings. This work studies the mutualism between cross-feeding bacteria in strains that supply
an essential amino acid for their mutualistic partner when both strains are exposed to antimicrobials.
When the strains are free of antimicrobials, we found that, depending on the amount of amino acids freely available in 
the environment, the strains can exhibit extinction, mutualism, or competition. The availability of resources 
modulates the behavior of both species. When the strains are exposed to antimicrobials, the population dynamics
depends on the proportion of bacteria that is resistant to the antimicrobial, finding that for low levels of the resource, 
the extinction of both strains is eminent. In contrast, for high levels of the resource, competition between both 
strains continues. An optimal control problem was then formulated in order to reduce the proportion of 
resistant bacteria, which showed that under cooperation, both strains (sensitive and resistant) are immediately controlled, 
while under competition, only the density of one of the strains is decreased, whereas its mutualist partner 
with control is increased. Finally, using our experimental data, we did parameters estimation in order to 
fitting our mathematical model to the experimental data.
